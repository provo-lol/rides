We __mask__ while cycling in a group:
- COVID sensible, as it allows us to chat safely
- Protects against pollen en pollution
- Disrupts facial recognition surveillance

That is the important part. Bring your bicycle, tricycle, mobility scooter, or other similarly speeded vehicle.

### Breaks

Each ride we'll take a mid-way break. Bring something to drink and eat if you like. (Carrying a bottle of water is _always_ a good idea!)

### Music

There will be music!
